In South-western China the mountain range spreads over massive areas. Having travelled from afar, it dramatically changes direction as it stretches south. In the East, mountains have always been seen upon as sacred. In the West, up until the 18th century, mountains were considered as something ugly and dangerous. In the era of industrialism and romanticism views changed. Mountains became entities to be conquered.

Note that none of the significant peaks of this specific mountain range have been successfully climbed. It has also been the site for one of the most deadly mountaineering accidents in history, killing all seventeen members of the expedition. In 2001, the local government passed a law banning all future climbing attempts on cultural and religious grounds.

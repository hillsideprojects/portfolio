Conditions of Sea is a public video installation installed temporarily in a 4Ã—3 meter window at Domkyrkoforum, a newly designed building part of Lund's Cathedral in Lund, Sweden. Shown during the evenings and at night, the video installation juxtaposed a silent view of an ocean within a public environment, thus attempting to create a tension between the conditionings of time, space and architecture. During one month, as viewers paced across the city square, they were met by a slowly moving seascape placed within a city framework.

Presented as part of Lunds kulturnatt 2013 and conceived with the support from Lunds kommun and Filmcentrum STHLM

Hillside Projects is a research/production group formed in 2011 by Emily Mennerdahl and Jonas BÃ¶ttern. They are based in Stockholm. Hillside Projects work collaboratively and often in dialogue with other thinkers and professionals from a variety of fields. Hillsides research predominantly focuses on aspects of history, culture and the conflicting relationship we have with the natural world. Through video, performance lectures and installations, the group experiment with ways of telling stories and the re-telling of stories. Lines between fact and fiction, knowledge and assumption become blurred as different voices and roles are explored. The group builds installations that employ material from archives as well as drawings, large works on paper, plants, photographs, text and sculpture. The installations and performance lectures explore ways of ordering and altering facts, events and experience. Hillside Projects playfully make use of an academic and scientific language, both in their presentation and choice of material. Slide projectors, over-head projectors, white-boards, power point etc. are used in non-traditional manners to create ephemeral works that lean more towards a realm of poetics.

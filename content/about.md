Hillside Projects is a research/production group consisting of Emily Mennerdahl and Jonas BÃ¶ttern. They create performance lectures, video and installations and play with ways of telling stories and the re-telling of stories. Lines between fact and fiction, knowledge and assumption become blurred as different voices and roles are explored. They experiment with ways of ordering and altering facts, events and experience whilst leaning toward a realm of poetics. The group playfully makes use of an academic and scientific language, both in their presentation and choice of material as they explore cultural, social and political narratives in a continuing discourse on nature.

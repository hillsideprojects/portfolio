Hillside Projects have developed a series of performance lectures, videos and installations about disappearing birds. These birds are metaphors for an enquiry into the idea about national boundaries and cultural belonging. The series focuses directly on the re-introduction of specific birds into nature and question the motivation behind this.
Who or what belongs where and who or what does not belong?

The first part in the series is Searching for the European Roller, a performance lecture, installation and a video. Approximately 20 minutes in length, the performance lecture is presented at conferences and also within a scene like built installation. It involves props and analogue artifacts as well as guest appearances from both real and fictitious “specialists” on the subject matter.  Applying and experimenting with characters and disparate uses of an authorative voice in telling the story of the bird, the lecture brings to surface questions around culture-nature, belonging and memory. The lecture is delivered with humor and sensitivity, re-tracing the memories and emotions of the blue bird and questioning its need for departure and the strong national desire for its return.

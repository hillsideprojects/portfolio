_Searching for the European Roller_ (2016)  is a lecture performance that weaves in and out of the history of a blue disappearing bird. Taking place within a scene like built installation; the lecture includes works on paper, drawings on white-board, plants, slide projector, over -head projector, bird bones, and a humidifier. Applying and experimenting with characters and disparate uses of an “authoritative” voice, the lecture brings to surface questions around culture-nature, belonging and memory. The lecture is delivered with humor and sensitivity, re-tracing the memories and emotions of the blue bird and questioning its need for departure and the strong national desire for its return.

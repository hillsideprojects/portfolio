Hillside Projects is a research and production group consisting of artists Emily Mennerdahl and Jonas BÃ¶ttern. Hillside Projects works interdisciplinary and mainly focuses on the development and changes in the natural world. Always trying to dismantle and re-consider the things, the things as we know them. The things we like to consider facts or even knowledge. Hillside Projects are committed to working in dialogue with other thinkers and professionals from a variety of fields.
